# MIXER

*STILL IN DEVELOPPEMENT*

Basic html/scss/js(jquery) website.

the website has no practicality it was created just to sharpen my skills in classic front-end dev.
I intend on remaking it with a js framework (probably React) in the future.

*right now upgrading the parent_frame/albums_frame page with the other pages to follow*
